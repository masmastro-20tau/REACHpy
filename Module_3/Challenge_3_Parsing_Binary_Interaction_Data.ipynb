        "# Challenge Problem 3: Parsing Binary Interaction Data\n",
        "\n",
        "There are many cases where computer software will output some data in a human readable format, instead of a machine readable format like the `.csv` files you've encountered in this course. In those cases, it is impossible to use functions like `np.loadtxt()` or `pd.read_csv` to parse the data. Instead, we require a judicious choice of the string parsing tools of python to get our data in a more machine-friendly format. Here, we encounter one example of this.\n",
        "\n",
        "The data for this exercise comes large scale simulations of globular clusters, star clusters which are very old and have up to millions of stars. In these environments, stars can pair up and form tight binary systems. When these tight binary systems encounter another single star or binary, figuring out the result of the gravitational encounter requires a high precision simulation, so this smaller simulation is quickly done and then the results of the interaction are put back into the larger simulation. This file contains a large number of these results for part of a single simulation of a globular cluster. Due to the size of the output, it was necessary to truncate the file. If you would like to see the full version of these results, you can download the cluster simulation results [here](https://cmc.ciera.northwestern.edu) using the options `N = 1.6e6`, `rv = 1`, `rg = 2`, and `Z = 0.0002` and looking at the `initial.binint.log` file. \n",

        "    * `v`: This is the relative velocity between the two inputs in units of something called the critical velocity. For explanation, see equations 1 and 2 in [Fregeau et al. (2004)](https://articles.adsabs.harvard.edu/pdf/2004MNRAS.352....1F).\n",

        "Your first task is to come up with a logical way of storing this data in a tabular format. There are two broad options. You can have a single large table for all the interactions and have some rows have empty columns depending on the output of the interaction. Or, you can split the data into multiple tables depending on both the inputs and the outputs. If you go with the second option, it might be useful to have one big table that contains the parameters of all the interactions (e.g., the time of the interaction, the index, the type, and the outcome) for easy tracking."
